# Math Game
## Introduction
Math Game is a beginner level c# application that allows users to play math games. There are 4 games; addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each game generate 10 random maths questions respective to the chosen game type and keeps track of 
the users score based on how many they get correct in that game so that it is eventually added to a list that the user can access to see their previous games and score in that session. The user can choose to play any of the games any number of times
until they choose to exit the program.
This project was a challenge provided by [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/).
## Future Plans
This project is not yet completed as the code can still be refactored to make it more efficient and void of errors. Here are the next steps:
1. Implement exception handling.
*This feature has not yet been implemented*
2. Implement the DRY principle to avoid making multiple functions.
